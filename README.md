Project Objectives

•	Fundamentals of Machine Learning: Understanding of supervised learning, classification, regression, overfitting, underfitting, and evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).

•	Deep Learning Concepts: Knowledge of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs - though less central here), and activation functions.

•	Transfer Learning: A clear understanding of what transfer learning is, why it is used, and common strategies like feature extraction and fine-tuning.

•	Image Processing Basics: Concepts such as image channels, resolution, pixel values, and basic image transformations.

•	Python Programming: Intermediate to advanced Python skills, including object-oriented programming, data structures, and standard libraries.

•	Data Handling with Pandas/NumPy: Proficiency in manipulating and analyzing data using these libraries.

•	Basic Web Development: HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript for front-end development, and understanding of server-side logic for the web application.
